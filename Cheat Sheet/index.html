        <tr>
          <td>&lt;strong&gt;</td>
          <td>Strong</td>
          <td>
            Indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or
            urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;span&gt;</td>
          <td>Span</td>
          <td>
            A generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not
            inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for
            styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they
            share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no
            other semantic element is appropriate.<code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is
            very much like a div element, but div is a block-level element
            whereas a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is an inline-level element.

        <tr>
          <td>&lt;s&gt;</td>
          <td>Strikethrough</td>
          <td>
            Renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the
            <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> element to represent things that are no
            longer relevant or no longer accurate. However,
            <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is not appropriate when indicating document
            edits; for that, use the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code> elements, as appropriate.
